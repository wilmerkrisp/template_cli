== todo notes for new project

* enable annotation processing for project
* change package name life.expert.algo.research.app
* todo - change gradle--use gradle wrapper task configuration
 - use autoimport
 - create dir for empty content root auto
 - using qualified names
 - delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle
* add gradle support to project
 - you MUST click* on right corner  "enable auto import"
* rename project name inside settings.gradle (rootProject.name)
* set main class name setted inside gradle.properties

== The Problem

.Description


== USER NOTES

I make the assumption that the size of the canvas is not more than the length of a single text screen 80 characters
, what acceptable to most console users.

Since at this stage the requirements are not detailed, it is assumed that the program behaves like a raster paintbrush, those figures can intersect and the paint fills the border if it gets into

== DEVELOPER INSTALLATION NOTES

* Please install
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html[*LATEST!* version java 12]

* Please install
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html[latest version gradle 5.1.1]

* Simpliest way - is to use project's gradle wrapper (with smallest gradle-wrapper.jar inside for gradle downloading).
But some organizations (banks:) do not allow projects to submit binary files.
The alternative approach to install gradle and generate gradle wrapper
[source,bash]
gradle wrapper

* for building project use
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/html/[gradle plugin]
[source,bash]
gradlew build


* for running use gradle command for generate distribution
[source,bash]
gradlew distZip

** goto folder and unpack
[source,bash]
/riso/build/distributions/riso-1.0.0.zip

** run java programm
[source,bash]
riso-1.0.0/bin/riso.bat

NOTE: sometimes when running on windows OS you may see a blank screen - then you need to press any key


* for convenience (not to look for them in the build folder) documents (related to the program) are copied to the docs folder


* if you want, for installing the same environment in IntellijIDEA set File--Settings repository = https://github.com/wilmerkrisp/idesettingrepository[git@github.com:wilmerkrisp/idesettingrepository.git] +
 and app template used  https://github.com/wilmerkrisp/apptemplate/tree/master/winter


== ARCHITECTURE NOTES

=== BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE

Imagine that this application is intended for employees of Bank branches and helps them to mark the workspace for scanning documents

Thus the app is relates to the .... domain for https://bian.org/servicelandscape/[banking standard BIAN]

* Since this application is an internal banking software, the assumption is used - the lack of internationalization




=== INFORMATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

* cover the test code of the most important classes of the subject area
in addition to unit tests, integration and functional tests have also been created
[source,bash]
gradlew test //for unit testing
gradlew testIntegration //for integration testing

** image:/docs/Code coverage testing report/coverage.png[width=700, link="/docs/Code coverage testing report/coverage.png"]



==== overall-level

* gradle used (see /build.gradle), please use gradle wrapper ./gradlew for running tasks
** project name inside settings.gradle (rootProject.name)
** main class name and version setted inside build.gradle

NOTE: IDE--Settings--Build--Gradle: +
select: Gradle wrapper customization in build script +
delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle

* project source sets:
** jmh - for benchmarking
** main
** test
** testIntegration

* Structure101 used for architecture control



* well-known libraries are widely used (Guava, Apache commons)
** in accordance with the principles of reference architectures of https://www.opengroup.org/togaf[TOGAF] architecture, the most well-established components are transferred to the library, here I use https://github.com/wilmerkrisp/himalaya[my own library]

** Lombok annotations are widely used, see configuration inside build.gradle (then /lombok.config autogenerated)

** logback used for logging,

NOTE: configuration file at /src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml
see log file at /riso.log


==== macro-level

* The app is SPA java console application

* this application uses  https://github.com/wilmerkrisp/patterns/blob/master/patterns.pdf[patterns from the classifier/vocabulary]

* partially used functional approach (Vavr, Cyclops)
** wrapping checked exceptions into bool, Try, Either, flow events, Optional depending on situations
** pattern matching inside Switch
** so as the excitement of the exceptions is expensive then all errors are reported as events of the flow

* reactive approach is used (Spring Reactor) for further parallel scaling of threads
** in the future, you should call all commands from the same Flux (Flux.create for example as in the Android reactive applications),
place processing (domain methods) in a separate thread and draw the result back in the UI thread

==== micro-level

* the following https://github.com/wilmerkrisp/conventions[coding standards and conventions were used]

* made benchmark test: ... complexity  of algo

[source,bash]
gradle jmh

* profiling an application,
please note that an external jprofile installation is required.
[source,bash]
gradle saveProfile


=== TECHNOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE

* The application is designed for one user.
* In performance it is assumed that it will create 100 runs a day.
* There are no requirements for the size of the application (the virtual workplace of a Bank employee takes no more than 2 gigabytes).
* Requirements to the level of application criticality by Bank classification: BO (business operational)

* monitoring and recovery from failures outside the scope of this work
* servers hardware, equipmetnt outside the scope of this work
